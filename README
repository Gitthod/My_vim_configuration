Learning and setting up vim can be a lengthy process. By using git submodules in combination with
vim packages you can clone my whole configuration including all the vim plugins that i use, with one
command.

type : git clone --recurse-submodules git@github.com:Gitthod/My_vim_configuration.git

This will clone my .vimrc file alongside the .vim folder. The --recurse-submodules is needed so each
plugin that i use is cloned inside  $(git_root)/.vim/pack/plugins/start/$(plugin_name) If you have
higher than 2.8 version of git you can add -j8 option to clone in parallel.

If you don't use this command and you just type :

git clone git@github.com:Gitthod/My_vim_configuration.git

You need to step inside My_vim_configuration folder and type:

	git submodule init git submodule update

To clone all the submodules.

After you clone everything just copy or link (with ln -s (folder | filename) ) the .vim folder and
.vimrc file in your $(home) folder.

You can examine my .vimrc to see in more detail what i use. But in summary :

<F4> : is mapped to toggle NerdTREE
<F8> : triggers Tlist which shows function names , var names and macros for c.
<F6> : can be used when we are in terminal mode and we want to change to normal mode.

Also i have remapped ctrl-n, ctrl-m, and ctrl-b to be used with ALE to find definitions of
functions, refernces or small descriptions. However you will need to install some Language
Server Protocol to use these mappings.

All the plugins that are commited as submodules are independent and you can find more information in
their official sites. The github links for these submodules can be found below:
